This is a cmake module with python script to convert Qt Ui 
files into a source file for compilation with Wt.

copy the cmake UseUI and scrupt folder into your CMakeModules
directory.

in your CMakeList.txt file add

"
include(UseUi)
...
add_ui_file_to_library(qtuifile.ui)
"

this will setup a cmake custom command to call the python 
script which will convert the .ui file into ui_filename.h
and include it in the build.

You will need to manually include the ui_filename.h into the 
header file of the class you are going to use the ui file in.
Once the file is included you can either inherit the class:

class NewUiClass:public Wt::WContainerWidget, Ui_Class
{
...
}

or setup a member variable like the defualt in Qt

class NewUiClass:public Wt::WContainerWidget
{
...
private:
    Ui_Class ui;
...
}

You will then need to call setupUi from your class constructor,
 depending on how you included the Ui_Class it will be either

NewUiClass:NewUiClass(...)
{
    setupUi(this);
}

for inherited or

NewUiClass:NewUiClass(...)
{
    ui.setupUi(this);
}

for member.
